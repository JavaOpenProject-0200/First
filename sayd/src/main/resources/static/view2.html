              Rabbits are sensitive and timid animals, unlike dogs and cats. Before adopting a rabbit, you have to study a lot about rabbits and think a lot about how to raise them. Rabbits may be good to live in nature. It may be difficult to get close as soon as a dog.
<br><br>
If you assume that you are raising a rabbit, you should never raise it in a cage. Rabbits are animals that live in large spaces. I have good hearing, so I'm even sensitive. Raising it in a quiet environment may be a good alternative. Rabbits are nocturnal animals that are active at night. Then, there are some things to be careful about when you raise a rabbit.
<br><br>
If you want to raise a rabbit in a cage,


When adopting a rabbit, consideration should not be given in the cage. It can be good to fence in a room to raise a rabbit. The space for raising a rabbit is about 2m wide and 3m long, and when you let a rabbit play outside the fence, you may try to eat anything such as a sofa or wallpaper. For this reason, you should consider cleaning up the furniture or take a proper look at the rabbit if it goes out of the fence. Bricks are always not available and can cause toenails to break.

Rabbits like dark and cozy spaces

Rabbits like dark and cozy spaces. It can be good to put something like a long basket on the side or make a cage covered with cloth inside the fence. Separate the space with a blanket and a floor on the floor inside the fence. The proper temperature for raising rabbits is 22 degrees. When a rabbit is lying down, the belly part may like cool things, so you may need the bare floor.

If you put a small blanket in the corner, you can wash the blanket frequently to see your bowel movements only. The cage must be covered with a cloth or a smooth material. It can also prevent rabbits from getting hurt by their feet. Wood pellets, sawdust, can be harmful to rabbit health. Do not use it as much as possible.

a log for a rabbit house

A log is a must for rabbits to grind their teeth and claws. It may be difficult for the owner to cut the rabbit's toenails himself. Your toenails are also sharp, so your toenails may get caught in a blanket. If the rabbit does not grind its teeth on the log, it may not like the smell of the tree. You can change it to another log.

If you raise a rabbit, it's soil for excavation

Rabbits may like to dig holes. You may need excavation-specific soil. Pet rabbits are an improved variety of oyster rabbits, and most rabbits raised at home have a habit of selling oysters. Because the habits of the past remain, we are looking for a place to sell oysters. It may be unfortunate to see them scratching walls or burrowing in blankets because they want to dig them. It may not be easy to find as much soil as a rabbit can dig an oyster in a home.

Raising in a Quiet Environment<br>

Rabbits with developed hearing may be sensitive to small sounds. If it is a noisy environment, rabbits can have a hard time living. Existing wild rabbits are animals that live in forests. Rabbits usually live by listening to birdsong when they live in nature. I started raising rabbits without knowing this when I was taking them.
